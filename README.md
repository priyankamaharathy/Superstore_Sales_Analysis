This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of analyzing and visualizing sales data for 10,000 transactions. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed to provide valuable business insights. The analysis includes regional performance, profitability, sales by segment, and cross-category trends. A Power BI dashboard was also developed to present the findings interactively.
